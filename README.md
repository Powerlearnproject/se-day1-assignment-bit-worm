Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

-> A software engineere is someone who develops software solutions i.e apps and programs to help solve real world problems using computers.

-> They are important in providing simple to use and reliable software to help professionals and other users accomplish their tasks and solve their problems.
They design, build and maintain their softwares to ensure smooth day to day activities. Example, the M-pesa software was developed by a software engineer and is
used by a wide range of users to perform daily money transactions in a fast, reliable and easy way.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

  1. The creation if high-level programming languages.
Before, programs were writen in machine language(0s and 1s) or using asembly language which took a lot of time and was hard to maintain.
It was also machine specific so program portability was an issue.
After the development of languages like C, C++, Java and python. Programming became easier and faster.

  2. Development of cross-platform tools like flutter. These tools enable software developers to use the same code to create apps that can run on many different devices with different operating systems.
This reduces development time and also helps in code maintainability. Improving cost of development.

  3. Development of cloud computing.
Cloud is a platform where you can use resourses hosted on a server somewhere and pay for it.
This allows developers to develop and test softwares even if they do not have the resouces for it physically.
Cloud also allows developers to colaborate on the same project from different locations and still manage to create a good software.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

1. Planning - This is where you come up with the idea, you look for investors and support.
You determine the cost, determine the requirements, predict how long the development process will take.

2. Analysis and Design - After coming up with the idea and gathering the requremints, you start an analysis to determine how the development will be done, how many teams will be required, the model that will be used. Then the system is designed with the information from the analysis team and development can begin.

3. Coding - After the analysis, design and determining the development process, the software development begins. This is where the designed system starts coming to life as developers create it.

4. Testing - After development, the software is tested and errors are solved. If it doesn't meet all the user requirements, more features are added.

5. Implementation - After the developers and testers are satisfied with the system, implimantaion begins. Differrent deployment methods can be used to implent the system, the include; parallel changeover, direct changeover, pilot changeover e.t.c

6. Maintanance - Once the system is up and running, it is monitored and incase of any errors, developers are called for maintanance. Also if the user requires new updates, the developers will scale the system accordingly.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

It is the craft of creating prompts that will enable you to get the best response from an AI with the exact answer/information that you need.

It is important because:
  1. You will get exactly what you need from the AI.
  2. It saves time because you get a perfect answer after the prompt.
  3. Minimizes AI errors because AIs aren't perfect and with a good prompt these errors are minimal.
  4. It will make using AI seem easy and satisfying.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

-> Write a program to get the marks of students.

Better prompt

-> Wtite a python program that accepts the input of 5 marks. The program then computes an average and assigns grades.

The grades are assigned as follows:

From 70 to 100 is an A

From 60 to 69 is a B

From 50 to 59 is a C

From 40 to 49 is a D

From 1 to 39 is an F
