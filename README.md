Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

-> A software engineere is someone who develops software solutions i.e apps and programs to help solve real world problems using computers.

-> They are important in providing simple to use and reliable software to help professionals and other users accomplish their tasks and solve their problems.
They design, build and maintain their softwares to ensure smooth day to day activities. Example, the M-pesa software was developed by a software engineer and is
used by a wide range of users to perform daily money transactions in a fast, reliable and easy way.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

  1. The creation if high-level programming languages.
Before, programs were writen in machine language(0s and 1s) or using asembly language which took a lot of time and was hard to maintain.
It was also machine specific so program portability was an issue.
After the development of languages like C, C++, Java and python. Programming became easier and faster.

  2. Development of cross-platform tools like flutter. These tools enable software developers to use the same code to create apps that can run on many different devices with different operating systems.
This reduces development time and also helps in code maintainability. Improving cost of development.

  3. Development of cloud computing.
Cloud is a platform where you can use resourses hosted on a server somewhere and pay for it.
This allows developers to develop and test softwares even if they do not have the resouces for it physically.
Cloud also allows developers to colaborate on the same project from different locations and still manage to create a good software.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

1. Planning - This is where you come up with the idea, you look for investors and support.
You determine the cost, determine the requirements, predict how long the development process will take.

2. Analysis and Design - After coming up with the idea and gathering the requremints, you start an analysis to determine how the development will be done, how many teams will be required, the model that will be used. Then the system is designed with the information from the analysis team and development can begin.

3. Coding - After the analysis, design and determining the development process, the software development begins. This is where the designed system starts coming to life as developers create it.

4. Testing - After development, the software is tested and errors are solved. If it doesn't meet all the user requirements, more features are added.

5. Implementation - After the developers and testers are satisfied with the system, implimantaion begins. Differrent deployment methods can be used to implent the system, the include; parallel changeover, direct changeover, pilot changeover e.t.c

6. Maintanance - Once the system is up and running, it is monitored and incase of any errors, developers are called for maintanance. Also if the user requires new updates, the developers will scale the system accordingly.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

-> Waterfall follows steps in order one coming after the other. You only move to the next step if the previous one is complete.
This approach takes longer to complete development but at the end you get a solid working system with minimal errors.
It is most appropriate to dvelop a system such us banking system where the system needs to be relaible,  minimal errors since any little error could mean a loss of huge sums of money.
it is also appropriate since banking systems need to be up most of the time, so a solid working system requiring less maintanance is perfect.

-> Argile is where the system is developed by repeating steps and scaling the system when needed, adding new features as you go.
Here the system is always up to date with the lates featues but you have a risk of errors and the system failing.
This is more applicable in game development since games are constantly being updated to entertain the users.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

-> A software developer is the one who writes code, the one who builds the system and solves any emerging errors.
They are responsible for:
  - Writing the code
  - Checking for errors
  - Debbuging the code
  - Maintaining the code
  - Scaling the system

-> A Quality Assurance Engineer makes sure that the developed software is up to standard and meets the requirements of the user.
They are responsible for:
  - Test case developoment. They come up with the best test strategies that will test the systems quality and come  up with the best results to provide a way forward.
  - They get information from other stakeholders on what the systeb should be like and provide a recomendation to the developers.
  - They identify defects in the software during development and collaborate with developers to solve them.
  - They review code and tests to come up with ways to improve the system.

-> Project manager oversees the entire software development life cycle.
They are responsible for:
  - Managing the teams developing the software.
  - Ensuring that the different teams are collaborating smoothly.
  - Ensure the every team does their part in time.
  - Relay the status of the project to other stakeholders.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

-> IDEs are softwares used by developers to write code and perform debugging onthe software. They are a one stop shop to everything a developer needs to create a working software/program.
Examples are:
  - VS code
  - Pycharm
  - Intelij
  - Eclipse

-> Version control Systems are what developers use to keep track of the cahnges they make during coding and development. They provide a neat where for the developer to know what change caused what to happen during development. Meaning they can know exactly where to revert to incase of errors.

The most famous version control is git. Others are, Apache Subversion and Mercurial, etc.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

-> Loosing progress of their work. This can be solved by use of a tool like github, which provides a cloud based saving system where developers can put their  work as they go. Github intergrates with git for version control.

-> Lack of resources. A developer can find they they don't have a certain required dependancy during development. This can be solved with IDEs, some IDEs like Visual Studio provide all the tools a developer might need during development, you just download what you need from the IDE itself and your tools are a click away.

-> Unable to collaborate with team members. When developing a software as a team, developers need to be able to collaborate on the work. The problem of  collaboratio has been solved by some IDEs by providing a platform on the IDE for developers to work on the same project at the same time while providing insight to each other.
Github also solves this problem with the pull and merge feature.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

-> Unit Testing - Testing small components of software to check for errors and see if they work correctly.
From this test, you will minimize the errors significantly sing every single part is tested thoroughly.

-> Intergration Testing - Testing how different components of software interact and seeing if they work correctly together.
This helps developers to know which tools will work best together in the program.

-> System Testing - Testing the entire software system for errors and if it is working as planned. This is usually done after the other tests.
This hepls developers know if they have come up with aworking system and helps the eliminate remaining errors from the system.

-> Acceptence Testing - Testing if the system meets requirement and if the system follows regulations.
This will determine wether anything should be added to the system.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

It is the craft of creating prompts that will enable you to get the best response from an AI with the exact answer/information that you need.

It is important because:
  1. You will get exactly what you need from the AI.
  2. It saves time because you get a perfect answer after the prompt.
  3. Minimizes AI errors because AIs aren't perfect and with a good prompt these errors are minimal.
  4. It will make using AI seem easy and satisfying.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

-> Write a program to get the marks of students.

Better prompt

-> Wtite a python program that accepts the input of 5 marks. The program then computes an average and assigns grades.

The grades are assigned as follows:

From 70 to 100 is an A

From 60 to 69 is a B

From 50 to 59 is a C

From 40 to 49 is a D

From 1 to 39 is an F
